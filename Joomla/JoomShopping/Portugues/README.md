# Adds portugues language translations to the Joomshopping extension

This extension needs to be zipped and installed in the Joomshopping components install/upgrade menu.

Note that the zipfile must not contain any pathname prior to "components" or it will not install correctly, for exmaple in Linux do the following to zip it.
```
cd /path/to/repo/Joomla/Joomshopping/Portugues
zip -r /tmp/pt.zip *
```

You can then install __/tmp/pt.zip__ into Joomshopping from the components menu.
