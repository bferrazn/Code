## Brazilian-Portugues language translations for Joomshopping

This extension needs to be zipped and installed in the _Joomshopping_ components _install/upgrade_ menu.

Note that the zipfile must not contain any path name prior to "components" or it will not install correctly, for exmaple in Linux do the following to zip it.
```
cd /path/to/repo/Joomla/JoomShopping/Portugues
zip -r /tmp/pt.zip *
```

You can then install __/tmp/pt.zip__ into Joomshopping from the components menu.
