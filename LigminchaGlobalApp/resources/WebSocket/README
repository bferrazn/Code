This extension creates a live bidirectional connection between all the wiki clients and the server, and between all clients via the server.

- The extension ensures that the WebSocket daemon is running
- Each client is given a unique ID if they don't already have one
- URL rewriting can route WS requests to the daemon so that the port doesn't need to be public
- Clients include their ID in WS requests
- The service ID is zero and default
- Messages are in the form (type, body, clients = array(0) )
- when a message arrives at the client or server an event of the type is raised

It may use the Python Bitgroup code, or perhaps this Perl library which looks very simple:
